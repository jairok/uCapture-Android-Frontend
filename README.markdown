uCapture-Android-frontend
=========================
This project aims to capture images from an Android device and send them on a remote server.

It's primarily a how-to about using the [PhoneGap API](http://phonegap.com) with a Rails 3 backend.<br/> 
You can find the Rails 3 backend project [here](https://github.com/jairok/uCapture-Backend)
